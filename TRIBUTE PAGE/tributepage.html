    <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (1931–2015) was not only a 
      distinguished scientist but also a great visionary and a humble human being. 
      His life is an inspiration for millions of young people. 
      Coming from a modest background, he rose to become the <b>11th President of India</b> 
      and earned the title of the <b>People’s President</b>.
    </p>


    <p>
      I deeply admire Dr. Kalam for his simplicity, dedication to education, 
      and his ability to dream big and inspire others to do the same. 
      His words, <i>"Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts 
      and thoughts result in action."</i> continue to motivate me every day.
